	It inherits amongst others from BuildingOwner, so it has building management capabilities.
	There is always one big reference per building. It is stored either in the world, the island

	The world comprises amongst others:
	   * players - a list of all the session's players - Player instances
	   * islands - a list of all the map's islands - Island instances
	   * grounds - a list of all the map's groundtiles

	                  { (x, y): tileref, ...}
	                 This is important for pathfinding and quick tile fetching.
	   * island_map - a dictionary that binds tuples of coordinates with a reference to the island
	   * ships - a list of all the ships ingame - horizons.world.units.ship.Ship instances
	   * ship_map - same as ground_map, but for ships
	   * session - reference to horizons.session.Session instance of the current game
	   * trader - The world's ingame free trader player instance (can control multiple ships)
	   * pirate - The world's ingame pirate player instance
