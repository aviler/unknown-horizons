"""Classes used for StatusIcon.

Code design note:
The conditions for the statuses could also have been placed here,
for more modularity and flexiblity.
This way, we'd need to touch the objects' privates sometimes though,
and we'd lose some direct interaction flexiblity. Therefore, the objects
now contain all the logic, this module just covers the data.

Priority:
[   0-1000[: low
[1000-2000[: medium
[2000-3000[: high
Keep the numbers unique to avoid confusion when sorting.
